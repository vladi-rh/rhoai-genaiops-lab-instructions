# 🔄 Update Canopy to Use Compressed Llama 3.2 FP8 Model

Let's take our experiment environment from Tiny Llama and point it to the FP8 one. We'll go through the same steps.

## 🦙 Update Llama Stack Configuration

1. Navigate to **OpenShift Console** → **Helm** → **Releases** and find your `llama-stack-operator-instance` release in the `<USER_NAME>-canopy` project.

2. Click on the release and select **Upgrade**.

3. Add the quantized Llama 3.2 FP8 model as another model endpoint to your Llama Stack like you did with TinyLlama previously. That way, we'd be able to access cloud model, TinyLlama, and to this new model.
    
    Add it under `models` by clicking `Add models`:

    - **Model Name**: `llama32-fp8`
    - **Model URL**: `http://llama-32-fp8-predictor.ai501.svc.cluster.local:8080/v1`

4. Click **Upgrade** to apply the changes.

5. Now let's point `backend` to this newly available model 😌 Find `canopy-backend` under **OpenShift Console** → **Helm** → **Releases**

6.  We need to change every `llama32` and/or `tinyllama` to `llama32-fp8`. And we can bump the `max_token` again. For `summarize`:

    ```yaml
    summarize:
      enabled: true
      max_tokens: 2048 # 👈 update this ❗️❗️❗️
      model: llama32-fp8 # 👈 update this ❗️❗️❗️
      prompt: "<your prompt>"
    ```

7. Click **Upgrade** to apply the changes.

### 🌳 Test Canopy with the New Model

Once Llama Stack and backend are back up, let's verify it can communicate with the quantized model.

1. Go to [Canopy UI](https://canopy-ui-<USER_NAME>-canopy.<CLUSTER_DOMAIN>) and test summarization. You can copy the text about Turkish tea from the previous chapters if you wish ☕️

2. You should receive a response from the quantized model, and still feel like you are using the unquantized one 😌 So why are we waiting to take it to the test and production environment?

### Move Test and Prod to On Prem 🦙

1. Let's first update Llama Stack configs. Go back to your workbench and open up `genaiops-gitops/canopy/test/llama-stack/config.yaml` for **test** and add new model name and model url:

    ```yaml
    ---
    chart_path: charts/llama-stack-operator-instance
    models:
      - name: "llama32"
        url: "http://llama-32-predictor.ai501.svc.cluster.local:8080/v1"
      - name: "llama32-fp8"     # 👈 Add this
        url: "http://llama-32-fp8-predictor.ai501.svc.cluster.local:8080/v1" # 👈 Add this 
    eval:
    enabled: true
    rag:                  
    enabled: true
    mcp:                
    enabled: true     
    ```
2. Push the changes:

    ```bash
    cd /opt/app-root/src/genaiops-gitops
    git pull
    git add .
    git commit -m "🏦 Switch to FP8 🏦"
    git push
    ```
3. Now let's update the `backend`. Open up `backend/chart/values-test.yaml` and update change every `llama32` to `llama32-fp8`.

    ```yaml

    LLAMA_STACK_URL: "http://llama-stack-service:8321"
    summarize:
    enabled: true
    model: llama32-fp8 # 👈 Update this 
    temperature: 0.9
    max_tokens: 4096
    prompt: |
        You are a helpful assistant. Summarize the given text please.
    information-search:
    enabled: true
    vector_db_id: latest
    model: llama32-fp8 # 👈 Update this 
    prompt: |
        You are a helpful assistant specializing in document intelligence and academic content analysis.
    student-assistant:         
    enabled: true
    model: llama32-fp8 # 👈 Update this 
    temperature: 0.1
    vector_db_id: latest
    mcp_calendar_url: "http://canopy-mcp-calendar-mcp-server:8080/sse"
    prompt: |
        You are ...
    ```

4. Now let's push the changes:

    ```bash
    cd /opt/app-root/src/backend
    git add chart/values-test.yaml
    git commit -m "🏦 Switch to FP8 🏦"
    git push
    ```

    Do you remember what happens when we make a change in the backend? Yes! evaluation pipeline kicks off! Navigate to OpenShift console > Pipelines > Pipeline Runs under `<USER_NAME>-toolings` namespace and observe the evaluations. 

5. You can follow the same steps for **prod** files to move production Canopy to on prem as well!

## What You've Achieved

Congratulations! You've transformed how RDU serves its students. Here's what you accomplished:

- **Mastered quantization fundamentals** — You now understand the trade-offs between precision formats (FP16, INT8, INT4) and can make informed decisions about compression strategies
- **Compressed a model hands-on** — Using llm-compressor, you applied GPTQ quantization and saw firsthand how a model shrinks without losing its capabilities
- **Validated quality with benchmarks** — You learned to use lm-evaluation-harness to prove that compressed models still meet production standards
- **Deployed through GitOps** — You updated Canopy to use the FP8-quantized Llama 3.2 3B model and pushed changes through your CI/CD pipeline

### What RDU Gained

By moving to an on-premises quantized model, Redwood Digital University achieved several critical wins:

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Data Sovereignty** | Student queries and academic data never leave RDU's infrastructure — no external API calls, no third-party data exposure |
| **Cost Reduction** | The FP8 model uses roughly half the GPU memory of FP16, allowing RDU to serve more students with the same hardware or reduce infrastructure costs |
| **Lower Latency** | On-prem inference eliminates network round-trips to external APIs, resulting in snappier responses for students |
| **Operational Control** | RDU owns the entire stack — no vendor lock-in, no surprise API deprecations, no usage-based pricing surprises |
| **Sustainability** | Smaller models consume less energy per inference, reducing RDU's carbon footprint while maintaining quality 🌳🌳🌳🌳|

The bottom line: RDU now runs a production-grade AI assistant that's faster, cheaper, and keeps student data exactly where it belongs — on campus.

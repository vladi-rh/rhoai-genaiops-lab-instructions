# Module 9 - On-Prem Practicum

> When student grades and personal data enter the chat, the cloud becomes a compliance minefield. Sometimes the safest path forward is keeping everything in-house. Let's bring your LLM on-prem 🏠

# 🧑‍🍳 Module Intro

RDU is expanding Canopy to handle student-related confidential data: grades, academic records, and personalized tutoring interactions. With regulations like FERPA and institutional security policies, sharing this data with external cloud providers isn't an option. The solution? Run your own LLM on-prem.

This module walks you through deploying models directly on your OpenShift cluster using vLLM. You'll learn how to evaluate models based on your hardware constraints, serve them locally, and update your Llama Stack and Canopy configurations to use these self-hosted endpoints. By the end, you'll have a fully functional on-prem AI stack that keeps sensitive data exactly where it belongs: on your own infrastructure.

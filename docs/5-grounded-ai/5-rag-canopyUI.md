# 🌐 Powering Canopy with RAG Capabilities

## Integrate RAG into Canopy

The Canopy application we deployed already has RAG built-in as you may have seen from the feature list on the left, we just need to enable the feature flag.

1. Go to your workbench and open the file `backend/chart/values-test.yaml`

2. Edit the file to contain the `information-search` feature flag. Feel free to change the prompt, this is the system prompt just like before.

    ```yaml
    LLAMA_STACK_URL: "http://llama-stack-service:8321"
    summarize:
     enabled: true
     model: llama32
     temperature: 0.9
     max_tokens: 4096
     prompt: |
       You are a helpful assistant. Summarize the given text please.
    information-search:         # 👈 add this block
     enabled: true
     vector_db_id: latest
     model: llama32
     prompt: |
       You are a helpful assistant specializing in document intelligence and academic content analysis.
    ```

3. Push the change to git:

    ```bash
    cd /opt/app-root/src/backend/chart
    git add values-test.yaml
    git commit -m "🔨 RAG feature added 🔨"
    git push
    ```

4. Open the Canopy UI (https://canopy-ui-<USER_NAME>-test.<CLUSTER_DOMAIN> if you have closed it since last time), change to the Information Search feature in the left menu and ask something like `what is the total credits in Biotechnology program in Redwood Digital University?`

Congratulations! 🎉  
You now have a fully functioning RAG system where you can ingest complex documents as needed.

But the question is, are we going to run the pipeline manually every time or do we have a better way to do this? And what about production? Are we going to push without any test?
Let's advance to the next section!
